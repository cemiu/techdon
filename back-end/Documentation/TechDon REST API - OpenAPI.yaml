  title: TechDon
  description: This is the REST API documentation for the end points for TechDon
    platform will allow students to sign up, register for items and receive them in
    a simple, easy and straight forward procedure. The main aim of the platform is
    to provide students from a less privileged backgrounds to be able to apply for
    electronics to be donated which in turn will assist them in their educational
    studies. We will integrate a first come first served online que system where students
    can apply and wait there turn to be donated electrical goods. Our purpose behind
    this procedure is to insure a fair and easy process o deciding who justifies to
    be given the device first.  We will incorporate an ID check system where students
    must upload their id to ensure they are eligible to receive the device. Donators
    can be an individual or a company looking to help better the quality of education
    of students. This will be done by them uploading pictures of the device which
    later found student to be donated to , contacts will be exchanged to be able to
    finalize the donation , if it’s a in person or shipped delivery.
